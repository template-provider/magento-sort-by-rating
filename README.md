# [Template Provider](https://www.template-provider.com/) Rating Extension for Magento

This extension is a sorting extension based by rating for magento.
Most extensions are using the mysql left join with the sales table.
This is a bad choice because the performance impact might be huge.
The solution is a daily update of the ordered products by a cron.
